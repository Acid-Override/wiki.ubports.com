Well, hello there! I see you've come to try and develop with us. Here's some of the information that you'll need. Know that we are still building this wiki, so we might not have everything that you want yet.

You can begin porting Ubuntu Touch to any phone with:
Android 4.4.2 (in the official Google tree, Nexus 4, not used by UBports)
CyanogenMod 12.1 (What we develop on, any device with this version will work in theory.)
Android 6.0.x (in the official Google tree, Currently broken)

This information will differ based on the type of device you want to port to.
