## Introduction

[Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) is a cross-platform open source and free IDE based on Delphi, that also supports ARM Linux natively. It uses [Free Pascal compiler](https://www.freepascal.org), and you can use it to compile once written code to a plethora of targets, including (but not limited to): Windows, OSX, Linux, and plethora of architectures, including Intel, ARM and many others. Both Free Pascal compiler and Lazarus IDE can be compiled, or installed from precompiled binaries/packages on Ubuntu Touch, using a default ARM Linux releases. In fact both **fpc** and **lazarus** packages are available in the default Ubuntu repositories, but most likely these are not the most recent versions, so on your Ubuntu Touch you could just run:
     
    sudo apt-get install fpc lazarus
     
Just that in reality there are few problems with this:
* on UT devices by default the system partition is read-only (can be easilyremounted to rw though)
* on UT devices by default the free space on system partition is quite low and might not be enough for installing both packages along with all dependencies (on Meizu MX4 phone with original UT only fpc package was possible to install, but not lazarus due to insufficient space). The resizing of the filesystem is not a very easy task.
* by default Lazarus IDE, which is a GTK app starts in multi-window mode, which does not work well when running gtk on the UT device via XMir. Lazarus can be configured into single window mode, which solves the problem. 

Laso Lazarus comes in QT mode, but built with an older QT than the version supported by UT. Also using Lazarus with OSK (on screen keyboard) is not convenient, but when using BT keyboard/mouse dongle over phones OTG/USB port, it works greatm, and UT will even show up a mouse pointer like on Ubuntu Desktop. Finally, one great way to use Lazarus is via ssh with X forwarding. in that scenario, although Lazarus IDE is installed and running off your UT device (phone/tablet) but it is forwarded via ssh onto your Ubuntu Desktop's monitor, and you also can use your desktop's keyboard and mouse to interact with it.

Before this wiki page gets full update, please check some external articles talking about all this:

Benefits of using Lazarus are:
* Lazarus IDE is one of the best. see: [What is the best IDE on Linux](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-IDE-for-Linux/answer/Krzysztof-Kamil-Jacewicz?srid=uKbMW)
* You kill multiple birds with one stone, because whatever you write for UT, you can also compile for Linux Desktop, Windows, OSX and other OSes
* you can actually create apps for UT device on the UT device itself!

## GTK vs QT

When compiling Lazarus app, it gets built against a widgetset. By default the widgetset is GTK (unless you are using QT Lazarus version), but you can change a widgetset in the Lazarus configuration. Even if you do, the version of QT that Lazarus uses is 4, whereas UT devices use newer QT5. There are QT5 bindings for Lazarus available, but reportedly they are not very recent.
The simplest way between design and production is to build standard GTK apps. Currently the [GTK port for Mir](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/06/ubuntu-devs-demo-gtk-apps-running-mir-unity-8) display server is only experimental and it is not sure if it will continue. But UT comes with XMir by default, which will run GTK apps on the phone itself: [X applications on Ubuntu Phone](http://kriscode.blogspot.tw/2016/09/x-applications-on-ubuntu-phone.html)

If you do go down this road, one think has to be kept in mind. Although Lazarus has support for high DPI, compiled apps do not detect the correct DPI value when used on the UT device. Probably this is because XMir layer does not report it correctly to the app when serving as a wrapper to some xorg specific APIs. Because of that, at least currently (because XMir might receive a patch at some point) it will be your task to manually adjust size of all the GUI elements when they are launched on the high DPI of a UT device. It is not a difficult thing, but has to be remembered about, otherwise the app on your phone will look very small, with tiny fonts, buttons, etc.

##  Deployment

You could package your compild app with something that UT recognizes, like click or snaps. But you can also deploy it in a generic way, not specific to UT platform. You just need to create a launcher that would show up on the Apps scope of your UT device, that will launch the compiled binary via XMir. Suppose your binary file is located at **~/.local/MyApp/myapp**, then you need to create a launcher file in **~/.local/share/appliations/MyApp.desktop** with this content:
    
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=<AppName>
    Comment=<your app description>
    X-Ubuntu-Touch=true
    X-Ubuntu-XMir-Enable=true
    Exec=<path_to_your_app>
    Icon=<path_to_your_icon>
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
     
this is basically all regular .desktop file format (if you are familiar with it on Ubuntu Desktop), but there are few UT-specific flags: X-Ubuntu-Touch and X-Ubuntu-XMir, which will assure that your app will get launched via the Xmir compatibility layer. This is also covered in the external article [X applications on Ubuntu Phone](http://kriscode.blogspot.tw/2016/09/x-applications-on-ubuntu-phone.html) that has been linked to in the begining of this wiki page.

## Use scenarios

**Number 1 use case: direct** is when you install Lazarus and FPC directly on your UT device, but unless you can ensure enough free space on your system partition, this can be troublesome.

**Number 2 use case: containers** is to install it inside a container on your UT device, becasue the container folder/image can fit somehwere in your userspace, which is portion of the filesystem that has all the storage for you to use. There are multiple container approaches to choose from, and this external link will introduce you to [Easy containers on Ubuntu Touch with qemu-debootstrap](http://kriscode.blogspot.tw/2016/12/easy-containers-on-ubuntu-touch.html)

**DISCLAIMER**
Both the 1st and the 2nd approaches will allow you to either start and use Lazarus IDE on your UT device screen, or via ssh forwareded X session.

**Number 3 use case: non-Mir ARM Linux**
It is very convenient (perhaps the most convenient because of problems related to 1st use case) to use Lazarus on another ARM Linux with a xorg based display server instead of Mir. Great scenario is if you have a single board computer like Raspberry Pi, and Ubuntu Mate (or other Linux with graphical session manager) running on it. Installing Lazarus and FPC will be absolutely straightforward in such a scenario, and compiled binaries, since the device is already ARM Linux, will be ready to be copied over onto your UT device, and will work there as well. Just remember about the XMir layer (it has to have a custom launcher file).

**Number 4 use case: qemulated ARM chroot**
on your intel-based Ubuntu Desktop, you can always create debootstrap chroot jail using qemu-system-arm, which will emulate ARM execution environment. It is not exactly a virtual machine approach, but it feels pretty much like it. Just that your guest OS will be ARM whereas your host is intel based. In fact, you can do that even on Windows host. whatever you create and compile inside such a chroot environment, you can just copy over to your UT device, because it will be a valid ARM Linux binary.
