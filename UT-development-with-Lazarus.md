[Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org) is a cross-platform open source and free IDE based on Delphi, that also supports ARM Linux natively. It uses [Free Pascal compiler](https://www.freepascal.org), and you can use it to compile once written code to a plethora of targets, including (but not limited to): Windows, OSX, Linux, and plethora of architectures, including Intel, ARM and many others. Both Free Pascal compiler and Lazarus IDE can be compiled, or installed from precompiled binaries/packages on Ubuntu Touch, using a default ARM Linux releases. In fact both *fpc* and *lazarus* packages are available in the default Ubuntu repositories, but most likely these are not the most recent versions.
