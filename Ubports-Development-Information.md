Well, hello there! I see you've come to try and develop with us. Here's some of the information that you'll need. Know that we are still building this wiki, so we might not have everything that you want yet.

You can begin porting Ubuntu Touch to any phone with:
Android 4.4.2 (in the official Google tree)
CyanogenMod 12.1 (What we develop on)
Android 6.0.x (Currently broken)
