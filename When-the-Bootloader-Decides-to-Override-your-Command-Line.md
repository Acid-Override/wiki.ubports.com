Things can get really nasty with mobile devices. Say, you want to append a few things to the kernel command line for booting with special instructions.

For example, you need a `console=` option in your command line or Upstart will get upset with you (more info [here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/ContainerArchitecture)). What, exactly, the parameter needs to be depends on your device... For Exynos devices, this might be a `ttySAC` guy. For Qualcomm, it might be a `ttyHS` device. Hopefully yours is set in your AOSP or CM repository. It'll be in BoardConfig.mk in any case. Maybe your device has its data partition named in a strange way, so that Ubuntu will not recognize it. You can work around this with `datapart="/dev/mmcblk0p..."`
    
But here comes the problem: The bootloader itself may want to offload a ton of strange cmdline arguments and overwrite your cmdline string just before the kernel starts. Also, some device trees will have a kernel cmdline parameter in the BoardConfig.mk, but it still will get ignored during boot. The bootloader dominates everything. So how to get it there then?

- Go to your kernel config file
- Set CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=tty0"
- Set CONFIG_CMDLINE_EXTEND=y

If this works, you're done. The EXTEND feature appends actually the bootloader cmdline AFTER ours. Some bootloaders have console=none or console=ram hardocded into their string. This will effectively overwrite our command again. What to do?

- Apply the following patch to your kernel:

 	pr_warning("Ignoring tag cmdline (using the default kernel command line)\n");
 #else
```
 
This will modify the way the cmdline is loaded in such a way so that our cmdline comes AFTER the bootloader cmdline. Very neat!
 
Last issue: The length. Some bootloaders totally overload the cmdline string, so that any character we append might get eaten up. ItÂ´s true! What to do?

Open your kernels /arch/arm/include/setup.h file and set:
     
     #define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE 2048
 
This should be enough even for the most bloated bootloaders on this planet!
