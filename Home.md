### Welcome to the UBports wiki!

Are you interested in Ubuntu touch? Does it look like something you would use as a daily driver? Or maybe you're just curious on what all of this is about.

The problem is that Ubuntu Touch support for devices is limited... which we want to change! We will do everything we can to make Ubuntu Touch accessible on a wide range of devices.

To accomplish this goal, we will work as a team and include everyone that wants to help. We want developers to come together and share their knowledge, allowing us to learn from each other and solve problems together!
