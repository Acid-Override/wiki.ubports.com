!!THIS WIKI IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, expect some missing content and bugs...!!!


Are you interested in Ubuntu touch? Does it look like something you would use as a daily driver? or may you just be curious on what this all is about.

The problem is that it the support for devices is limited to a small amount of devices... This is what we want to change, we will do everything we can to make this a accessible to a wide amount of devices.

So what we will do to reach this goal is to include everyone that want to help, and work as a team! We want developers to go together and share knowledge, that way we will be able to learn for each others and solve problem together!
