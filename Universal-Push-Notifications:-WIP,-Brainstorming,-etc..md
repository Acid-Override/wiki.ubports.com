## Motivation ##
Currently there is no open, universal push infrastructure existing on this planet that will allow independent OS projects to push messages between (mobile) devices. The goal is to provide first a concept that would make such a infrastructure possible. It should be hosted on distributed servers, maintained by individuals or organizations.

## Participants ##
Currently the following groups of people showed interest:

 * Sailfish OS developers
 * UBports developers
