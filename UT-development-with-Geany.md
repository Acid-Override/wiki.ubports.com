## About Geany
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geany):
> Geany (IPA:ʒeːniː) is a lightweight GUI text editor using Scintilla and GTK+, including basic IDE features. It is designed to have short load times, with limited dependency on separate packages or external libraries on Linux. It has been ported to a wide range of operating systems, such as BSD, Linux, macOS,[4] Solaris and Windows. Because Windows lacks a virtual terminal equivalent, the Windows port lacks an embedded terminal window. Also missing from the Windows version are the external development tools present under Unix, unless installed separately by the user.[5] Among the supported programming languages and markup languages are C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, LaTeX, CSS, Python, Perl, Ruby, Pascal, Haskell, Erlang, Vala and many others.[6]

> In contrast to traditional Unix-based editors like Emacs or Vim, Geany more closely resembles programming editors common on Microsoft Windows such as Programmer's Notepad or Notepad++, both of which also use Scintilla.
