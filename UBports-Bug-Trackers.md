This is a listing of UBports bug trackers and their purposes.

## Devices

Device-specific bug trackers are used to report problems that you find while using a device. This could include app or device crashes, hardware access issues, or other general wierdness that isn't found in other devices. If you find a bug that affects multiple devices but not *all* devices, report the bug in one of the devices that it affects then use the "Also affects" link to add the other device.
