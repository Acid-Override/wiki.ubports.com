WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

It seems that getting ADB access can be a nightmare sometimes, especially for devices that cannot boot into GUI.

## The easiest possibility: build properties ##
Search your device tree for an .mk file which sets the default for the USB port:

    persist.sys.usb.config=mtp

and change it to:

    persist.sys.usb.config=mtp,adb

Clean your out directory from: boot.img, system & root folder. With a bit of luck thatÂ´s all you need to do. 

## The hardest one: Bypass via RNDIS adapter & timed configuration job ##
Thanks to Marius we also know about this method for some time. It is based on the possibility to switch the USB port to RNDIS mode after initrd has messed it up. Here are the steps:

- For this to work you need to grab a modified initrd from ubports - [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9Ee5skiHSnncUJBZERSS3IyWlE).
- copy this ramdisk to phablet/ubuntu/ubuntu_prebuilt_initrd as "initrd.img-touch"
- Inject BOARD_USE_LOCAL_INITRD := true into your device BoardConfig.mk
- Open your kernel config and find CONFIG_CMDLINE parameter, add "usb_debug" there
- Probably you also want to set CONFIG_CMDLINE_EXTEND="y" as otherwise the bootloader will overwrite it.
- make your tree.
- go into recovery and flash the modified boot.img
- It should stop at the boot logo. Connect via USB and see if your desktop recognizes an RNDIS adapter
- On the first round, there will be dhcp available, so try to telnet to 192.168.2.15
- you should get into BusyBox minimalistic shell.
- paste the following shellscript  into the console:

```bash
cat <<EOF > start.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo "continue" > /init-ctl/stdin
sleep 15
mkdir -p /sys
mount sys -t sysfs /sys
echo 0 > /sys/class/android_usb/android0/enable
sleep 1
echo 18D1 > /sys/class/android_usb/android0/idVendor
echo D001 > /sys/class/android_usb/android0/idProduct
echo rndis,adb > /sys/class/android_usb/android0/functions
echo 1 > /sys/class/android_usb/android0/enable
sleep 1
start adb
ifconfig rndis0 192.168.2.15
ifconfig rndis0 up
EOF
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh &
```

- You will loose now again the connection via RNDIS. Fear not, after the 15sec timer the script will try to reestablish it!
- In the second round you will probably not have DHCP again. You need to manually configure your IP address e.g. 192.168.2.20/24
- With some luck, you also get ADB! Try adb devices...
