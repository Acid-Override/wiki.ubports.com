# Whishlist
* BQ E4.5 as core device (due to number of used devices)
* configureable UserAgent string for the browser
* cursor movement keys in the OSK
* convergence of Canonical with freeoffice.
* apps should not stop running when they have things to do. Like when commands are running in the terminal, when making a Skype call etc.
* bluteooth getting for calls in our cars
* T9 dialer
* Custom SMS sound
* Possibly per-app notification sound (so that Dekko/Telegram notification sound can be different from the SMS one)
* How about listing mediahub apps in sound indicator? It could list the apps, but hide the control buttons where no app is open. When you open the app, it could jump to the top of the list and display the controls.
* System/OpenStore app updates using the transfer indicator, so that they could be downloaded and installed in background and multiple ones simultaneously.
* wireless display / aethercast for fairphone 2



## Application specific
* Dekko: threaded view/deletion
* Dekko: correct display of attachments
* Chromium
* VLC
* Alzip
* utorrent or equivalent
* installing Android applications
* adblocker in the webbrowser 
* Camera app has very low qualitiy and some settings don't work together. If I turn HDR on, then flashlight gets off, and so on.
* Music app should be more comfortable and start faster. Sometimes stops playing without reason.
